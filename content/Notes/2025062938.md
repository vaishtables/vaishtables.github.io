## Outline
### Introduction
### Character Analysis
1. Ukpik exemplifies healthy psychosocial, biosocial, and cognitive development at middle childhood.
2. The plot centers on a key concern of psychosocial development for children during this period, cultivating a growth mindset.
3. Ukpik pursues a goal (learning to sew) and is discouraged by her results.
> She cries, “Anaana, I will never be able to get this” [@aglukarkHunaUkpikLearns2022]
  
> It is realistic that she is frustrated and displaying static thinking about her ability as belief in the capacity to improve “does not come naturally to 6- to 11-year-olds, whose concrete operational thinking can lead to discouragement and quitting ” (Berger, 2023, p. 659) when trying something new.
  
> Her anaana’s advice is supportive, “It just takes time and practice” [@aglukarkHunaUkpikLearns2022].
4. Her mother is modelling a growth mindset for her daughter, emphasizing that hard work will lead to progress.
5. This is crucial as the level of growth mindset in schoolchildren has been found to be particularly asssociated with the level of growth mindest in their mothers [@chenLongitudinalAssociationChildrens2023].

1. Her mother’s sewing lessons are also developmentally appropriate with respect to Ukpik’s biosocial maturation.
2. Note that Ukpik’s mother endeavours to teach her how to make garments when her brain has matured to enable her to concentrate enough to learn.
3. Maturation of the prefrontal cortex during middle childhood endows children with the capacity for selective attention
> Ukpik demonstrates this consistently, focusing on her mother’s instructions and observing her movements.
4. The book is accurate in displaying that there are limits to these gains in executive functioning as Ukpik does eventually become restless.
5. Her mother’s response, here too, is ideal for her development as she encourages her to go play after their lesson rather than continuing to practice.
6. Schoolchildren’s executive functioning has been consistently associated with physical activity.
7. Ukpik is portrayed as an active child who enjoys exploring which is consistent with her ability to attend carefully.

1. The subject of garment preparation is also a suitable skill to impart during middle childhood to use and develop cognitive skills.
2. When Ukpik’s anaana tasks her with stringing beads, a challenge Ukpik is eager to take, she is demonstrating scaffolding for her daughter’s zone of proximal development.
3. Setting objects (i.e., beads) in a set order is an instance of seriation, an ability that associated with this age.
4. Moreover, the joint activities Ukpik and her mother engage in are beneficial for Ukpiks development of spatial cognition as with guidance from caregivers, fiber arts have been demonstrated to be effective means of exercising emerging cognitive faculties.


1. Ukpik is active in her development in that she eagerly takes to sewing
2. Anaana discusses continuity vs. discontintuity

> “Instead of being told that “failure is not an option,” they are encouraged to “fail again, fail better” (Smith & Henriksen, 2016, p. 6).” (Berger, 2023, p. 659)

This concept (a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset) does not come naturally to 6- to 11-year-olds, whose concrete operational thinking can lead to discouragement and quitting if they decide they are bad at sports, or math, or whatever.” (Berger, 2023, p. 659)

> “Thus, as with most developmental advances, the potential for psychological growth is evident. However, advance is not automatic—family and social context affect whether a more realistic, socially attuned self-concept will be a burden or a blessing, and cultures vary.” (Berger, 2023, p. 661)

#### Draft 1

Ukpik exemplifies healthy psychosocial, biosocial, and cognitive development during middle childhood.

The plot centers Ukpik’s motivation to learn to sew. Children like Ukpik in the concrete operational stage are easily discouraged by setbacks, believing their abilities are fixed and as such, it is critical foster a growth mindset to empower children to pursue goals even after failure [@bergerDevelopingPersonChildhood2023]. Such an opportunity is depicted during Ukpik’s first sewing lesson, when she cries, “Anaana, I will never be able to get this” [@aglukarkHunaUkpikLearns2022]. In response, her mother is supportive, encouraging, “It just takes time and practice” [@aglukarkHunaUkpikLearns2022]. Her mother’s response is ideal. Indeed, it has been found that level of growth mindsets among schoolchildren are associated particularly with those of their mothers.

Anaana’s sewing lessons are also shown to be developmentally appropriate with respect to the biosocial gains of middle childhood. She has elected to teach Ukpik a new skill at an age when her brain has matured enough to use selective attention to concentrate on her mother’s instructions. But the book is realistic about the increases in self-control during this period as Ukpik eventually becomes restless and loses focus. It is significant that although her mother stresses the importance of hard work and practice, she also understands the value of play. The development of executive functions is linked to physical activity in schoolchildren. So it is developmentally accurate that Ukpik is depicted as a very active child and as an attentive student. 

The book is also right to show through Ukpik’s sewing lessons the cognitive faculties that emerge and can be honed with mentorship. For instance, in Piagetian terms, it is possible for Ukpik to exhibit seriation, an operation that would allow her to arrange objects in sequence. Her anaana facilitates her development by tasking her with completing a string and then ten more in

“The next morning, Anaana began to clean the caribou skins. Ukpik knelt right beside her anaana, watching and waiting. “Ukpik, go and get the little ulu that your ataatatsiagq, your grandfather, made for you,’ Anaana said. “I will need your help cleaning the caribou skins, but you must listen to me and be very careful with your ulu.”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 9)

“When she returned, Ukpik couldn’t help but ask, “So Anaana, will I get to work with the beads, too?” “Yes, Ukpik,” Anaana replied. “But first I will need your help with the skins. We must prepare those, and then we will get to the beads.”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 9)

“Ananna took Ukpik’s hand and guided it alng the skin gently. Ukpik felt a slight change in texture and excitedly asked, “You mean like this?”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 9)

“”We have to be sure they are properly dried because we cannot waste any of these skins. Remember, I said you would have to be patient.” “Okay, Anaana, but when do we start working with the sungaujait? Is there anything I can do with them while we wait?” Ukpik couldn't hide her impatience at getting her hands on the beautiful beads.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 14)

“Anaana thought for a moment and decided to string a row of beads that Ukpik could follow. If Ukpik could follow Anaana’s pattern, the beads could become part of the finished project.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 14)

““Follow this beading pattern,” Anaana said, handing Ukpik the first strand of beads. “Show me a string of these beads when you are done. If it works well, then you can make me ten strings.”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 15)

“Anaana took Ukpik’s hand and, facing each other, they begin crunching the skins beneath their feet. Ukpik giggled. “This is fun, Anaana!”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 17)

“Ukpik watched her mother working with her sakuut. She mimicked her movements, and Anaana peeked at Ukpik from time to time with a smile on her face.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 18)

“After sewing their mittens for a while, both Ukpik and Qopak were very restless and ready to move on from sewing to exploring the tundra.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 22)

“Ukptk understood and sensed that what her mother was telling her was very important. She focused her attention on her sewing. After a bit more time had passed, Ukpik stopped to take a look at her stitches. They were loose and crooked. Then she peeked at her mother’s work. Her stitches were perfect. “Anaana, |will never be able to do this!” Ukpik exclaimed in frustration.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 26)

““You willnot get it perfect in a day, Ukpik. That is why oO say you and Qopak willjoin me here every MORES andpractise your stitching before you go out and play,” Anaana ~ said with a smile. “Don't fret, love, you will get it. It just takes time and practise.” Ukpik took one” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 27)

“In sum, from early childhood through adolescence, engagement with spatial activities along with appropriate scaffolding by adult caregivers helps improve spatial skills.” (Bennett-Pierre and Gunderson, 2023, p. 5)

“At the same time, there are large individual differences and substantial room for improvement in young children’s spatial skills. For example, training studies have successfully improved 5-to 8-year-olds’ representations of continuous magnitude, spatial scaling, and mental rotation at immediate post-test with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 0.87 for mental rotation after a one-week computerized intervention, Cheung et al., 2020; d = 0.58 for mental rotation after a 5 min mental rotation intervention and d = 0.45 for spatial scaling after a 5 min spatial scaling intervention, Gilligan et al., 2020; d = 0.42–0.73 for spatial visualization and form perception after a 3–4 week intervention, Mix et al., 2021).” (Bennett-Pierre and Gunderson, 2023, p. 6)

“Importantly, children in early and middle childhood can engage in a variety of fiber arts practices” (Bennett-Pierre and Gunderson, 2023, p. 6)

“Vygotsky would not be surprised at one finding of recent research: Internationally as well as nationally, children who begin school at age 4 or 5, not 6 or 7, tend to be ahead in academic achievement compared to those who enter later. This effect is still apparent at age 15, although not in every nation (Sprietsma, 2010). Vygotsky would explain the variation in impact by noting that in some nations early education is far more interactive, and hence better at guided participation, than in others.” (Berger, 2023, p. 607)

“Vygotsky emphasized that the lessons a child learns vary by culture and school, not merely maturation.” (Berger, 2023, p. 608)

“Girls Can’t Do It As Vygotsky recognized, children learn whatever their culture teaches. Fifty years ago, girls were in cooking and sewing classes. No longer. This 2012 photo shows 10-year-olds Kamrin and Caitlin in a Kentucky school, preparing for a future quite different from that of their grandmothers.” (Berger, 2023, p. 608)

“By contrast, in some other cultures learning occurs socially and indirectly, by observation and joint activity (Rogoff, 2016).” (Berger, 2023, p. 609)

“For example, one study tested children’s ability to remember an overheard folktale. Children who grew up within Native American communities were accustomed to learning by observation, and thus they were better at remembering the folktale than other U.S. children (Tsethlikai & Rogoff, 2013).” (Berger, 2023, p. 610)

_Una Huna?: Ukpik Learns to Sew_ (Aglukark, 2022) is the second picturebook by Susan Aglukark about Ukpik, a curious young girl living in the Arctic, with illustrations by Amiel Sandland and Rebecca Brook. Like the target audience of children aged 6 to 8 years, Ukpik is in middle childhood. The story follows her as she learns to sew from her mother, Anaana, who has been working on a secret project. When Ukpik’s father, uncle, and cousin return from their hunt with caribou skins, she is eager to learn and participate in sewing, just as Anaana is excited to teach her. Although Ukpik is keen to begin beading, Anaana ensures she first acquires foundational skills, guiding her through the processes of cleaning, softening, drying hides, and eventually beadwork and stitching mittens. The story emphasizes the importance of patience and perseverance when learning new skills. It also highlights the significance of family, intergenerational learning, and cultural traditions in Inuit life, as Ukpik receives support from her parents, cousin, and grandfather throughout her journey.

Ukpik exemplifies healthy psychosocial, biosocial, and cognitive development typical of children in middle childhood (ages 6–11), aligning well with the book’s intended audience. Psychosocially, the story centers on Ukpik’s desire to learn sewing—a developmentally appropriate challenge for her age. Early in the book, she becomes discouraged by her initial difficulties and cries, “Anaana, I will never be able to get this” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 20). This emotional reaction reflects a common pattern among school-aged children, whose concrete operational thinking can contribute to discouragement and static views of ability. As Berger (2023) explains, “belief in the capacity to improve does not come naturally to 6- to 11-year-olds, whose concrete operational thinking can lead to discouragement and quitting” (p. 659).

Ukpik’s mother responds supportively, emphasizing practice over perfection: “It just takes time and practise” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 27). By modeling a growth mindset, Anaana plays a key role in shaping her daughter’s developing self-concept. This aligns with research showing that children’s mindset orientation is associated with that of their caregivers, particularly mothers (Chen et al., 2023).

Biosocially, Ukpik demonstrates the maturation of selective attention and executive function, hallmark traits of middle childhood (Berger, 2023). When Ukpik watches her mother and focuses on sewing tasks, “she understood and sensed that what her mother was telling her was very important. She focused her attention on her sewing” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 26). However, the book also realistically portrays the limits of these abilities, as both Ukpik and her cousin eventually become restless: “both Ukpik and Qopak were very restless and ready to move on from sewing to exploring the tundra” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 22). Rather than forcing continued practice, Anaana allows the children to take a break—supporting research linking physical activity in children with enhanced executive functioning (Bjorklund, 2022; Davis et al., 2011).

Cognitively, Ukpik’s experience reflects the importance of guided participation and cultural transmission. Her mother carefully scaffolds the sewing lessons within Ukpik’s zone of proximal development (Berger, 2023), first modeling how to clean hides and later assigning Ukpik the more challenging task of beadwork. This type of learning—through observation, joint activity, and embedded cultural practices—is consistent with what Rogoff (2016) describes as indirect learning common in many non-Western cultures. Ukpik’s participation in traditional Inuit garment-making also supports the development of spatial cognition. Research suggests that engagement with fiber arts in childhood enhances spatial visualization and form perception (Bennett-Pierre & Gunderson, 2023). These benefits are further strengthened when scaffolded by caregivers, as occurs in Anaana’s instruction.

In sum, the book presents a developmentally accurate and culturally rich depiction of a middle childhood-aged girl acquiring a new skill through the support of family, tradition, and guided learning.

Two central developmental themes emerge in _Una Huna?: Ukpik Learns to Sew_: the contrast between continuity and discontinuity, and the view of children as active learners.

Continuity vs. discontinuity is thematically embedded in the generational transmission of knowledge and the changes introduced by contact with non-Inuit ways of life. Anaana reflects on learning sewing from her own mother and grandmother, while also acknowledging how cultural knowledge is evolving: “Things changed with the Captain’s arrival. Now Ukpik and the other children know that there is another world out there. They are growing up with this knowledge—what they can imagine has changed, which means they have changed” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 30). As Berger (2023) notes, “children experience simple growth, radical transformation, improvement, and decline as well as stability, stages, and continuity” (p. 48). This tension is evident in the story’s portrayal of traditions being preserved through teaching, even as the broader cultural landscape shifts around the characters.

The second theme—children as active learners—is central to the book’s depiction of Ukpik’s cognitive development. From the beginning, she is portrayed as curious, motivated, and observant. She watches her mother work with tools like the sakuut and mimics her movements, asking questions such as, “Does softening the skin make it easier to sew?” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 18). Berger (2023) emphasizes that “young children are active learners, with new brain connections enabling new thoughts” (p. 460), and that they often gain logical skills through active, guided experience (p. 463). This aligns with how Anaana scaffolds each stage of the sewing process to fit within Ukpik’s zone of proximal development (Berger, 2023; Vygotsky, as cited in Rogoff, 2016). Ukpik does not passively receive knowledge; she participates in its construction, learning through doing.

Together, these themes reinforce the story’s deep developmental relevance: children are embedded in cultural and historical trajectories, yet they shape and are shaped by their learning environments through active engagement.

_Una Huna?: Ukpik Learns to Sew_ is written for children aged 6 to 8, a period marked by increasingly sophisticated language skills, metacognitive development, and heightened emotional awareness (Berger, 2023). The language and content of the storybook are developmentally appropriate for this audience, both in terms of linguistic complexity and thematic relevance.

The vocabulary used in the book matches the expanding lexical capabilities of children in middle childhood, who are able to understand compound phrases, emotional descriptors, and culturally specific terms. For instance, Anaana says, “Naammaktuujaaliqtut amiit. Looks like you got ceiceh furs. Quvianaq! I am happy!” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 6). This sentence blends English with Inuktitut, exposing children to multilingual vocabulary while clearly scaffolding understanding through context and repetition. Nation et al. (2022) argue that book language offers a higher density of unique and emotionally expressive words than spoken language, and this is evident here. These exposures are not only appropriate but beneficial for vocabulary acquisition and cultural literacy.

Syntactically, the book often employs embedded clauses and relative constructions, which children in this age group are learning to comprehend and produce (Nation et al., 2022). For example, when Anaana explains the drying process, she states: “We have to be sure they are properly dried because we cannot waste any of these skins. Remember, I said you would have to be patient” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 14). The cause-effect relationship in this statement is conveyed through subordinate clauses, reflecting the type of complex syntax children are capable of grasping as they enter Piaget’s concrete operational stage (Berger, 2023).

The book’s emotional content is also age-appropriate. Ukpik’s eagerness to participate and her visible frustration when she cannot yet begin working with the beads—“Ukpik couldn’t hide her impatience” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 14)—reflects self-conscious emotions like pride and discouragement that are emerging in this stage of development. According to Berger (2023), the development of metacognition and emotional regulation is a hallmark of middle childhood, and the book models positive emotional coping through Anaana’s calm, supportive guidance.

Overall, the book's language and emotional content are well-suited to its intended audience. It introduces linguistic structures and emotional concepts that are just challenging enough to support development, without overwhelming readers. As Nation et al. (2022) note, books offer rich input that helps scaffold language, literacy, and social-emotional growth. _Una Huna?_ successfully engages readers in this developmental sweet spot.

While _Una Huna?: Ukpik Learns to Sew_ accurately portrays the developmental processes of middle childhood, particularly the importance of patience and guided learning, one potential improvement relates to how the story handles the theme of growth mindset. Although the narrative emphasizes the value of practice and perseverance—hallmarks of a growth-oriented message—the arc feels incomplete. After Anaana tasks Ukpik with daily stitching practice and introduces her to beadwork, the book does not follow through by showing Ukpik’s progress or a moment of accomplishment.

This omission represents a missed opportunity to reinforce the core developmental message. As Berger (2023) notes, children aged 6 to 8 are still learning to connect effort with outcome and often struggle with discouragement when success is not immediate (p. 659). Explicitly showing Ukpik improving at stitching or completing a small beadwork project would affirm the story’s message that ability grows through effort. It would also provide an emotionally satisfying resolution that supports metacognitive development and self-efficacy.
