_Una Huna?: Ukpik Learns to Sew_ (2022) is the second picturebook by Susan Aglukark about Ukpik, a curious young girl living in the Arctic, with illustrations by Amiel Sandland and Rebecca Brook. Like the target audience of children aged 6 to 8 years, Ukpik has begun middle childhood. The story follows Ukpik as she learns to sew from her mother, Anaana, who has been working on a secret project. When Ukpik’s father, uncle, and cousin return from their hunt with caribou skins, she is as excited to learn sewing as Anaana is to teach her. Although Ukpik is eager to take on a project, especially one using beautiful beads, her mother ensures she acquires the skills required first, guiding her through the processes of cleaning, softening, and drying hides, beadwork, and stitching mittens. All the while, Ukpik and readers are shown the importance of practice and patience when learning something new. Also stressed is the significance of family, community and tradition in Inuit culture as Ukpik relies on help from her father, grandfather, and cousin and fdsfdsfdsfd

- Ukpik likes to play with Qopak & her dog, her mother encourages her to do so. Physical exercise is good for developing selective attention
- Ukpik’s brain maturation & selective attention, executive control, embodied cognition allows her to learn sewing which requires coordination of body and mind.
- Instruction and practice are core to the book’s message. Anaana provides the scaffold for Ukpik and its culturally informed.
- Joint activity is being used.
- seriation, sequence, beading pattern, zone of proximal devel. to see if Ukpik can do it
- dev theme: contintuity vs. discontinuity discussion of generational differences in learning to sew & other skills
- devl theme: active learning, social modelling, Bandura, Anaana sewing is modelled for Ukpik who gets it going

> “However, people at every age are social and active, not just reactive. Instead of responding merely to their own direct experiences, “people act on the environment. They create it, preserve it, transform it, and even destroy it . . . [in] a socially embedded interplay” (Bandura, 2006, p. 167). That social interplay is the foundation of social learning theory (see Table 2.2), which holds that humans sometimes learn without personal reinforcement. As Albert Bandura, the primary proponent of this theory, explains, this learning often occurs through modeling, when people copy what they see others do (also called observational learning) (Bandura, 1986, 1997).” (Berger, 2023, p. 109)
> “Unlike infants or adolescents, school-age children grow slowly and steadily, in body and brain. That makes self-care easy—from dressing to bathing, from making lunch to getting to school. Brain maturation allows children to sit in class without breaking pencils, tearing papers, or elbowing classmates. In these middle years, children are more self-sufficient than they were in early childhood, and, in most cases, they are not yet troubled by adolescent body changes” (Berger, 2023, p. 558)
> “Selective attention is partly the result of maturation, but it is also greatly affected by experience, particularly the experience of playing with others. School-age children not only notice various stimuli (which is one form of attention) but also select appropriate responses when several possibilities conflict (Wendelken et al., 2011).” (Berger, 2023, p. 560)
> “How could body movement improve intellectual functioning? A review of the research suggests several possible mechanisms, including direct benefits of better cerebral blood flow and increased neurotransmitters, as well as indirect results of better moods (Singh et al., 2012). Many studies have found that cognition and action are connected in children, an example of embodied cognition, the idea that thinking is closely allied with physical actions and health (Pexman, 2017).” (Berger, 2023, p. 560)
> “By contrast, in some other cultures learning occurs socially and indirectly, by observation and joint activity (Rogoff, 2016).” (Berger, 2023, p. 609)
> “Unlike Piaget, who thought children would discover most concepts themselves, Vygotsky stressed instruction from teachers and other mentors who provided the scaffold between potential and knowledge by engaging each child in his or her zone of proximal development.” (Berger, 2023, p. 607)
> “Girls Can’t Do It As Vygotsky recognized, children learn whatever their culture teaches. Fifty years ago, girls were in cooking and sewing classes. No longer. This 2012 photo shows 10-year-olds Kamrin and Caitlin in a Kentucky school, preparing for a future quite different from that of their grandmothers.” (Berger, 2023, p. 608)
> "But, also be proud of your brain’s quick responses, evident toward the end of middle childhood. Quick reaction time and selective attention (both explained in Chapter 11) aid every social and academic skill. For instance, being able to calculate when to utter a witty remark and when to stay quiet is something few 6-yearolds can do. By the end of middle childhood, children (1) realize that a comment could be made, (2) decide what it could be, (3) think about the other person’s possible response, and in a split second, and (4) know when something should NOT be said. More broadly, it is now evident that the prefrontal cortex coordinates many hubs and subcortical regions of the brain “very rapidly (prior to conscious awareness)” as the brain automatically responds to stimulation (Blair, 2016, p. 3). This rapid, unconscious processing is the result of all of the neurotransmitters and neurological hubs of early and middle childhood. The brain of a typical 6- to 11-year-old is ready to learn, rapidly and well. Because of plasticity, once something is learned, it tends to stick. What do you remember learning during middle childhood?” (Berger, 2023, p. 612)
