           > “The idea that change is possible is crucial. This concept (a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset) does not come naturally to 6- to 11-year-olds, whose concrete operational thinking can lead to discouragement and quitting if they decide they are bad at sports, or math, or whatever.” (Berger, 2023, p. 659)  
           
           > “Thus, as with most developmental advances, the potential for psychological growth is evident. However, advance is not automatic—family and social context affect whether a more realistic, socially attuned self-concept will be a burden or a blessing, and cultures vary.” (Berger, 2023, p. 661)

“The next morning, Anaana began to clean the caribou skins. Ukpik knelt right beside her anaana, watching and waiting. “Ukpik, go and get the little ulu that your ataatatsiagq, your grandfather, made for you,’ Anaana said. “I will need your help cleaning the caribou skins, but you must listen to me and be very careful with your ulu.”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 9)

“When she returned, Ukpik couldn’t help but ask, “So Anaana, will I get to work with the beads, too?” “Yes, Ukpik,” Anaana replied. “But first I will need your help with the skins. We must prepare those, and then we will get to the beads.”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 9)

“Ananna took Ukpik’s hand and guided it alng the skin gently. Ukpik felt a slight change in texture and excitedly asked, “You mean like this?”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 9)

“”We have to be sure they are properly dried because we cannot waste any of these skins. Remember, I said you would have to be patient.” “Okay, Anaana, but when do we start working with the sungaujait? Is there anything I can do with them while we wait?” Ukpik couldn't hide her impatience at getting her hands on the beautiful beads.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 14)

“Anaana thought for a moment and decided to string a row of beads that Ukpik could follow. If Ukpik could follow Anaana’s pattern, the beads could become part of the finished project.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 14)

““Follow this beading pattern,” Anaana said, handing Ukpik the first strand of beads. “Show me a string of these beads when you are done. If it works well, then you can make me ten strings.”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 15)

“Anaana took Ukpik’s hand and, facing each other, they begin crunching the skins beneath their feet. Ukpik giggled. “This is fun, Anaana!”” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 17)

“Ukpik watched her mother working with her sakuut. She mimicked her movements, and Anaana peeked at Ukpik from time to time with a smile on her face.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 18)

“After sewing their mittens for a while, both Ukpik and Qopak were very restless and ready to move on from sewing to exploring the tundra.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 22)

“Ukptk understood and sensed that what her mother was telling her was very important. She focused her attention on her sewing. After a bit more time had passed, Ukpik stopped to take a look at her stitches. They were loose and crooked. Then she peeked at her mother’s work. Her stitches were perfect. “Anaana, |will never be able to do this!” Ukpik exclaimed in frustration.” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 26)

““You willnot get it perfect in a day, Ukpik. That is why oO say you and Qopak willjoin me here every MORES andpractise your stitching before you go out and play,” Anaana ~ said with a smile. “Don't fret, love, you will get it. It just takes time and practise.” Ukpik took one” (Aglukark, 2022, p. 27)

“In sum, from early childhood through adolescence, engagement with spatial activities along with appropriate scaffolding by adult caregivers helps improve spatial skills.” (Bennett-Pierre and Gunderson, 2023, p. 5)

“At the same time, there are large individual differences and substantial room for improvement in young children’s spatial skills. For example, training studies have successfully improved 5-to 8-year-olds’ representations of continuous magnitude, spatial scaling, and mental rotation at immediate post-test with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 0.87 for mental rotation after a one-week computerized intervention, Cheung et al., 2020; d = 0.58 for mental rotation after a 5 min mental rotation intervention and d = 0.45 for spatial scaling after a 5 min spatial scaling intervention, Gilligan et al., 2020; d = 0.42–0.73 for spatial visualization and form perception after a 3–4 week intervention, Mix et al., 2021).” (Bennett-Pierre and Gunderson, 2023, p. 6)

“Importantly, children in early and middle childhood can engage in a variety of fiber arts practices” (Bennett-Pierre and Gunderson, 2023, p. 6)

“Vygotsky would not be surprised at one finding of recent research: Internationally as well as nationally, children who begin school at age 4 or 5, not 6 or 7, tend to be ahead in academic achievement compared to those who enter later. This effect is still apparent at age 15, although not in every nation (Sprietsma, 2010). Vygotsky would explain the variation in impact by noting that in some nations early education is far more interactive, and hence better at guided participation, than in others.” (Berger, 2023, p. 607)

“Vygotsky emphasized that the lessons a child learns vary by culture and school, not merely maturation.” (Berger, 2023, p. 608)

“Girls Can’t Do It As Vygotsky recognized, children learn whatever their culture teaches. Fifty years ago, girls were in cooking and sewing classes. No longer. This 2012 photo shows 10-year-olds Kamrin and Caitlin in a Kentucky school, preparing for a future quite different from that of their grandmothers.” (Berger, 2023, p. 608)

“By contrast, in some other cultures learning occurs socially and indirectly, by observation and joint activity (Rogoff, 2016).” (Berger, 2023, p. 609)

“For example, one study tested children’s ability to remember an overheard folktale. Children who grew up within Native American communities were accustomed to learning by observation, and thus they were better at remembering the folktale than other U.S. children (Tsethlikai & Rogoff, 2013).” (Berger, 2023, p. 610)

_Una Huna?: Ukpik Learns to Sew_ (2022) is the second picturebook by Susan Aglukark about Ukpik, a curious young girl living in the Arctic, with illustrations by Amiel Sandland and Rebecca Brook. Like the target audience of children aged 6 to 8 years, Ukpik has begun middle childhood. The story follows Ukpik as she learns to sew from her mother, Anaana, who has been working on a secret project. When Ukpik’s father, uncle, and cousin return from their hunt with caribou skins, she is as excited to learn sewing as Anaana is to teach her. Although Ukpik is eager to take on a project, especially one using beautiful beads, her mother ensures she acquires the skills required first, guiding her through the processes of cleaning, softening, and drying hides, beadwork, and stitching mittens. All the while, Ukpik and readers are shown the importance of practice and patience when learning something new. Also stressed is the significance of family, community and tradition in Inuit culture as Ukpik relies on help from her father, grandfather, and cousin and fdsfdsfdsfd


- Ukpik’s mother, her anaana, has decided to teach her a new skill, sewing, that requires concentration and coordination of fine motor capabilities.
- Indeed, in middle childhood the maturation of the prefrontal cortex enables children to be able to use selective attention, which Ukpik displays when she “sits and watches carefully.”
