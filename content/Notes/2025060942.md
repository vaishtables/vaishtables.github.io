# Hulling  
  
For a hundred years I had lain  
in the bedrock  
heavy, penitent, waiting.  
This stone could not be wrought.  
Turn it to silt, scattering in water and wind.  
Till then, let me be  
numb, untouched.  

Then, springtime comes,
looks on me and
there have been a thousand springtimes.
Still, a warm ray is flickering on my face and I â€” 
Don't dare tend to it. 
But something is stirring. Betraying change.
