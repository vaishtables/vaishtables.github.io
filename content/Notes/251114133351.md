> **Role playing in theatre and everyday life**
In the dramatic arts, actors take on the role of the characters they play. A large literature on "perspective taking" and "theory-of-mind" in psychology has failed to examine this process of impersonation. We are studying role playing in actors and non-actors using functional MRI with the intent of shedding light on brain areas whose activity changes when people portray another person, whether fictional or real. Our collaborators on this project are Alexandru Berceanu (University of Theatre and Film, Bucharest, Romania) and Nisha Sajnani (New York University).

> **The cognitive and neural basis of creativity**
Perhaps the most integrative topic of research in the lab is the search for the cognitive and neural mechanisms of creativity. Given the broad interdisciplinary nature of the lab's research, we are approaching creativity in a multi-arts fashion, with the aim of looking at both domain-general and domain-specific aspects of creativity in the brain.

> **Other areas of interest**
Other areas of interest include the creativity/aesthetics interface, the neural basis of drawing and writing, the biological basis of religion, cinema and the brain, and the narrative nature of conversation.

#### Why
- his work analyzes creativity, which is a unique research interest
- I consider myself a creative person (have formal training in Indian classical dance, am a writer, studied English and was particularly fascinated by literary crticism concerning aesthetics)
- admittedly not into the musicology work

Subject: Prospective MSc student – Fall 2026

Dear Dr. Brown,

My name is Vaishnavy Puvipalan, a recent Honours Psychology graduate from the University of Toronto, and I intend to apply for the MSc in Psychology (Cognition/Perception) at McMaster for Fall 2026.

I am very interested in studies out of the NeuroArts Lab examining creativity as it relates to theatre and literature. Your paper on conversational alignment caught my eye as I have prior experience in experimental linguistics and computational approaches to cognition. Quantifying mechanisms of language is a core research interest of mine and I am eager to continue exploring work in this area.

I am also personally invested in the study of creativity and aesthetics as I have creative pursuits, I’ve published fiction, have formal training in Indian classical dance, and studied literature extensively during undergrad.

as such, I would to learn more about the program and potentially work with you at X university. Will you be accepting graduate students for the fall of 2026?

Thank you for your time and consideration.\
Sincerely,\
Vaishnavy Puvipalan\

Dear Dr. Brown,

My name is Vaishnavy Puvipalan, and I am a recent Honours Psychology graduate from the University of Toronto. I am writing as I intend to apply to the MSc in Psychology (Cognition/Perception) program at McMaster University for Fall 2026.

I am drawn to the research conducted in the NeuroArts Lab, especially work examining creativity as it relates to theatre and literature. Your paper on conversational alignment particularly caught my attention, as I have prior experience in experimental linguistics and computational methods. Quantifying the mechanisms of language is a core research interest of mine, and I am eager to continue exploring this area.

Beyond my academic interests, I am personally invested in the study of creativity and aesthetics. I have published fiction, hold formal training in Indian classical dance, and studied literature extensively during my undergraduate career. As such, I am excited by the possibility of gaining insight into cognitive foundations of these pursuits.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to learn more about your research program and the possibility of working with you at McMaster University. Will you be accepting graduate students for Fall 2026?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Vaishnavy Puvipalan
