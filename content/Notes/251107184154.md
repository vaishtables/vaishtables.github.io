I am applying to the Master’s program in Psychology to pursue experimental and computational approaches to cognition. My research interests concern how humans acquire, represent, and update information during learning, language processing, and decision-making. I developed this focus through coursework in statistics and cognitive psychology and through research experiences that progressively moved from qualitative inquiry to controlled experimentation and model-based analysis.

My first research experience was in the Jackman Scholars-in-Residence program, where I worked with Professor Jessica Fields on the Beyond Bullying Project, a study of LGBTQ+ youth narratives collected through digital qualitative methods. I examined how cultural and institutional context shapes the perception of risk in school settings and participated in discussions of the ethical dynamics between peer researchers and academic researchers. Our team presented these findings at the Annual Conference of the Canadian Society for the Study of Education. I later continued this line of work in the 4theRecord project, where I conducted, transcribed, and thematically coded interviews on risk-taking among young women during the COVID-19 pandemic. I contributed to a co-authored book chapter on feminist research ethics that emerged from this project. These experiences established my interest in decision-making but also made clear the limits of qualitative data for isolating cognitive mechanisms.

To study cognition under more controlled conditions, I joined a linguistics lab after completing coursework in language processing. The project investigated how readers interpret emoji in written communication, specifically whether their meaning shifts depending on whether they appear inside the sentence, substitute for a word, or follow the message as a separate element. A key methodological issue in prior work was that static text could not distinguish real-time processing of post-text emoji. I addressed this by developing an animated chat-style interface in JavaScript that included a controlled temporal delay between sentence and emoji, enabling experimental isolation of post-text interpretation. This project demonstrated the extent to which cognitive questions depend on task design and provided my first experience with conference presentation and manuscript preparation.

By my final year, I had developed a sustained interest in studying cognition through formal modelling. After completing advanced coursework in statistics, I joined the LeeMTL Lab under the supervision of Professor Andy Lee and completed an honours thesis on approach–avoidance learning. Working with an existing dynamic decision-making paradigm, I implemented hierarchical Bayesian reinforcement learning models in Stan and tested whether personality traits, such as grit, predict differences in learning from reward versus punishment outcomes. The models supported this prediction, showing higher punishment-based learning rates among participants high in grit. I presented this work as a poster at the Lake Ontario Visionary Establishment Conference in 2025. This project confirmed for me that computational modelling is an effective way to infer latent cognitive processes that are not accessible through behavioural data alone.

Across these projects, I have developed experience in all stages of the research process, including task implementation, data analysis, and dissemination. I am proficient in R, Python, and Stan for statistical and computational modelling, and I have programmed experimental tasks using JavaScript and Gorilla. I also have training in qualitative methods, including interview design, transcription, and thematic coding in Dedoose. My work has been presented through posters, conference talks, and co-authored publications
