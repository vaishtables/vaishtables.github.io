# Interpersonal Relationships Paper: The Female Dating Strategy
  
- Paper should be critiquing pop psych dating advice
- FDS is an interesting angle because we're inundated with redpill/manosphere content (in psych too, lots of papers about incels) but their distaff counterparts are understudied
- the official FDS blog uses psych in their articles
- vetting strats?
    - probably stereotypes about men to avoid on dating apps & rationale
    - cohabitation
        - on SES
        - FDS is anti-cohabitation because it allows men to defer their proposals ("why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?")
