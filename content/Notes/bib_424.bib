  abstract = {Objective: The goal of this study is to develop a new assessment tool to measure attachment. Method: The study consisted of six stages. Initially, in order to develo an itm pool, the current attachment literature and measuring tools were examined. The clarity of the items and the face validity were evaluated with a group of 20 ‘judges’. The draft scale was given to 307 individuals, using the Brief Symptom Inventory as a criterion measure. Selection of the items was completed with factor analyses, and the resulting 33 item scale was named, “Attachment-Based Mental Representation Scale” (ABMRS). Later, with a sample of 407 individuals, the reliability and validity analyses of this 33item scale were conducted, using different criteria measures namely, Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory, The Parental Bonding Instrument, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Stress Audit Scale. Then, the test-retest reliability was investigated with a new sample of 60 individuals. With the addition of 7 more items, the Scale was administred to 283 people to investigate the psychometric properties. Lastly, the new 40-item Scale, with the items written in a mixed order, was applied to a different sample of 264 participants, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Results: The scale has a six-dimensional structure, and it has been observed that the reliability coefficients of the dimensions vary between 0.72 and 0.86. These sub-dimensions can be grouped together and evaluated as “Secure Attachment” and “Insecure Attachment”. Conclusion: It can be argued that the ABMRS validly and reliably measures the attachment phenomenon with various dimensions for Turkish culture.},

@book{franzenFreedom,
  title = {Freedom},
  author = {Franzen, Jonathan},
  abstract = {From the National Book Award-winning author of The Corrections, a darkly comedic novel about family  Patty and Walter Berglund were the new pioneers of old St. Paul – the gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation. Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter – environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man – she was doing her small part to build a better world.  But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz – outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival – still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become 'a very different kind of neighbor,' an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?  In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's intensely realized characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.},

Tinning fish is an old-world preservation method that gives us modern convenience. These fish—anchovies, mackerel, sardines, octopus, and squid, among others—are packed at their peak of freshness, meaning you get all the flavour at a fraction of the cost of buying fish fresh. The 75 recipes range from the simplest snack (try sardines on a Wasa cracker with mustard and lemon) to dishes for holiday entertaining (like a lamb roast studded with anchovies and served with rosemary roasted potatoes). Also included are weeknight pastas, such as Spaghetti with Smoked Oysters and Egg Yolks, and even a meat lover’s favourite Steak with Anchovy Butter. Tinned fish is a natural part of an outdoor picnic spread—anchovy, bread, and butter make the perfect sandwich—but they can also be served at a party, especially a warm Cod Brandade on toasts. Tinned fish is perfectly on-trend and for good reason: they’re sustainable, economical, full of variety, and a great choice to keep stocked in your pantry.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},
