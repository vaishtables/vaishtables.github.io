# Intimate Relationships Final Paper Outline

## Introduction
1. Background
    1. What is r/FemaleDatingStrategy? Why does it matter?
2. Define “playing hard-to-get”
playing hard-to-get
: “appearing uncertain in one’s interest and/or difficult to attract and romantic or sexual outcomes.” (Hazel et al., 2023, p. 368)
3. playing hard-to-get per FDS ideology involves 1) establishing high standards and 2) leveraging intimacy, especially sexual intimacy, judiciously
   > “A high-value woman has her own career, hobbies, and a great social life that fulfills her emotional needs, so if she does welcome a man in her life, he better be amazing.” (FDS subreddit, 2020, p. 2)
   > "Generous men are a non-negotiable. While we believe in having your own career and making your own money, a man still has to add financial value to your life and make you feel like he can take care of you. This means not splitting the bill and not dating financially challenged men.” (FDS subreddit, 2020, p. 3)
   > “The majority of the advances you receive from men are not of any value, because many men are sex-driven, low effort, and entitled. However, there are also men out there who can be amazing boyfriends and husbands who know how to be a man and how to take care of you in all ways.” (FDS subreddit, 2020, p. 2)
   > “As women, we have the responsibility to be ruthless in our evaluation of men. We do ourselves and humanity no favors allowing men to exhibit subpar behavior and be rewarded with our attention. Thus, be ruthless in cutting off men who add no value to your life (happiness, emotional security, financial).” (FDS subreddit, 2020, p. 2)
   > “Don't have sex before commitment has been established (if you're looking for a relationship) or before he has demonstrated value and investment (if you're looking for FWBs).” (FDS subreddit, 2020, p. 3)
4. Having reviewed the evidence, although the general ideas of cultivating self-worth and exercising caution when selecting intimate partners, I disagree with the FDS conception of romantic relationships as mainly transactional. Moreover the specific tactics recommended are not founded in evidence, and contrary to their aims, are ineffective for forming relationships that are healthy. 
    1. Presenting as high-maintenance reflects a prioritization of financial investment over other non-material aspects of romance that does not bode well for an intimate relationship
    2. Men who fail to meet high standards are not necessarily deterred by their inadequacy anyway
    3. A man’s valuation of a woman cannot necessarily be indexed by his sexual desire for his partner; chastity does not necessarily lead to the impression of high-value and sex appeal does not necessarily cheapen her
    4. Men do not necessarily lie less when they sexually desire a potential mate

## Draft

The subreddit _r/FemaleDatingStrategy_ (FDS) is an online community where women exchange dating advice, much of it framed around cultivating the image of a “high-value woman.” Central to FDS ideology is the practice of “playing hard-to-get,” defined as “appearing uncertain in one’s interest and/or difficult to attract and romantic or sexual outcomes” (Hazel et al., 2023, p. 368). In FDS discourse, this includes maintaining high standards, exercising caution in sexual intimacy, and projecting an aura of selectivity through self-presentation. For example, members emphasize that women should “have \[their] own career, hobbies, and a great social life” while also requiring that men “add financial value” to a woman’s life and demonstrate generosity before being granted intimacy (FDS subreddit, 2020, pp. 2–3). While FDS frames these practices as empowering, the overarching tone suggests that relationships are transactional, with women leveraging scarcity and high standards to filter out “low-value men.”

Having reviewed the empirical literature, I argue that while certain aspects of FDS advice (such as prioritizing self-worth and exercising caution) are constructive, the movement’s transactional emphasis is flawed. Specifically, the strategies recommended by FDS are not always supported by empirical evidence and may in fact undermine the formation of meaningful, high-quality relationships.

A recurrent emphasis in FDS is that women should project the image of a “high-value woman” by looking polished, financially independent, and self-assured. This emphasis is not solely about self-empowerment but functions instrumentally as a screening mechanism: by signaling selectivity and affluence, women purportedly discourage financially insecure men from pursuing them.

Empirical evidence partly supports this claim. Chen, Wang, and Ordabayeva (2023) introduced the concept of the _mate screening motive_, showing that when women receive abundant romantic attention, they increase their preference for luxury goods as a way to deter undesirable suitors. Across six studies, women facing crowded dating pools expressed stronger preferences for luxury brands, both in field settings (e.g., participants at singles’ events) and in controlled experiments, compared to conditions with fewer mating options. These findings align closely with FDS claims, demonstrating that luxury consumption can function as an effective filtering signal in early romantic encounters.

However, the evidence also raises important limitations. First, Chen et al. (2023) themselves acknowledged that luxury signaling could backfire. In follow-up analyses, they noted that conspicuous consumption may lower men’s expectations regarding other forms of relational investment, leading them to prioritize financial contributions over emotional or interpersonal effort. This limitation concerns **construct validity**, as luxury signaling may not reliably capture or communicate women’s broader mate value beyond financial standards.

Second, the study did not examine socioeconomic status (SES) as a moderator. The samples consisted largely of university students, dating-service clients, and online respondents. Women from higher-income backgrounds may authentically use luxury brands to filter suitors, but for lower-income women, this tactic may appear deceptive or unsustainable. This omission limits the **external validity** of the findings, since the results may not generalize across women from diverse class backgrounds.

Taken together, while luxury consumption can function as a mate-filtering tool, its effectiveness is conditional. Heavy reliance on luxury signals risks narrowing relationships to financial exchanges and excludes women who cannot realistically participate in conspicuous consumption. A more balanced approach—signaling values across financial, emotional, and interpersonal domains—would better serve women seeking equitable, high-quality relationships.

In addition to appearance and luxury consumption, FDS emphasizes that women should cultivate high levels of education, strong career prospects, and financial independence as markers of “high value.” The rationale is that such achievements will help women filter out unsuitable partners, as men who are “low value” will feel intimidated or disqualified by women’s accomplishments.

Empirical research challenges this assumption. Neyt, Baert, and Raeymaeckers (2019) conducted a field experiment on Tinder in which female profiles were randomly assigned different levels of education. Contrary to the stereotype that men are discouraged by ambitious women, the results showed that men were not significantly less likely to express interest in highly educated women compared to those with lower levels of education. This finding directly undermines the FDS claim that education can serve as a mate-screening strategy. If men are not deterred by advanced degrees, then education alone cannot reliably function as a filter for “low-value” suitors.

However, the study’s design raises questions about its **construct validity**. Education was operationalized strictly by degree level, but not all degrees carry the same financial or social implications. For instance, a bachelor’s degree in engineering signals stronger earning potential than a master’s in a lower-paying field such as public administration. Treating “advanced education” as a homogeneous category overlooks these nuances and conflates different trajectories of socioeconomic status. This simplification weakens the study’s conclusions about the role of education in shaping dating preferences.

Furthermore, the study does not account for the financial realities tied to higher education. While Neyt et al. (2019) implicitly treat advanced degrees as straightforward markers of social status, in practice, pursuing graduate studies can generate significant debt without guaranteeing financial independence. For many women, especially those outside lucrative fields, additional education may reduce rather than enhance economic standing. Because FDS explicitly ties “high value” to career and financial stability, the study’s narrow treatment of education as a proxy for hypergamy overlooks these important dynamics.

Taken together, although the findings show that men are not intimidated by highly educated women, the study’s limitations make it difficult to conclude that education alone functions as a reliable signal of high value. By oversimplifying the link between education and wealth, the research overlooks how field of study and financial realities mediate whether educational attainment enhances or undermines women’s mate value.
