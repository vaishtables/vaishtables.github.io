The internet has dramatically reshaped the way people approach intimate relationships in the modern day. Online platforms provide users unprecedented access to communities where individuals exchange anecdotes, advice, and discourse about dating. Although such sites have served supportive spaces, they also provide fertile ground for toxic ideologies that may produce distorted worldviews and expectations for romantic relationships. For instance, the “manosphere” is a loosely connected set of forums, blogs, and influencers centered on masculinity characterized by misogynistic rhetoric whose development has received substantial scholarly attention. Its distaff counterparts, however, remain comparatively understudied. On Reddit, the r/FemaleDatingStrategy (FDS) subreddit exemplifies this female perspective, offering women a space to discuss dating from a generally heteropessimistic lens. Central to the FDS worldview is the belief that heterosexual relationships should be approached in contractual terms, with women leveraging their sexuality strategically in exchange for resources from men. The community’s official guidebook, a compilation of contributions from members,explicitly advises women to withhold sex until a man demonstrates sufficient investment. To members of FDS,  investment (material and emotional) distinguishes the “high value man” (HVM) from a male partner unworthy of long-term commitment or “low value man” (LVM) (FemaleDatingStrategy, 2020). In this view, sexual access is figured as a bargaining chip. 

In the Female Dating Strategy Handbook, one of the core tenets commands, “Don't have sex before commitment has been established if you're looking for a relationship or before he has demonstrated value and investment,” with the rationale that, “The majority of the advances you receive from men are not of any value, because many men are sex-driven, low effort, and entitled. However, there are also men out there who can be amazing boyfriends and husbands who know how to be a man and how to take care of you in all ways.” Analogies conceiving of sex as currency and dating as a marketplace in FDS parlance resonate with theoretical frameworks of relationship economics in study of intimate relationships. Indeed, the link between constructs of “mate value” and “investment” has been the subject of robust body of psychological research, yet these works are entirely neglected by the authors of FDS resources. Having reviewed these studies, I contend that the FDS views of heterosexual relationships as fundamentally transactional is problematized by empirical evidence. Specifically, the claim that women withholding sexually ensures investment from their male mates contradicts findings that suggest more complex dynamics with respect to the role of sex in mens’ valuation of female mates. Based on this evidence, I argue against the FDS recommendation that women should wield their sexuality and physical intimacy as leverage in relationships with men. 

In contrast to the advice circulated on r/FemaleDatingStrategy, recent works by Gurit Birnbaum and colleagues highlights the role of sexual desire as a catalyst the initiation and maintenance of intimate relationships. Across several studies conducted over the past decade, these studies reflect that sexual desire and sex facilitate bonding in straight couples. Rather than diminishing women’s mate value when expressed, sexual desire often motivates men to act in ways that secure their relationships. This body of work provides a starkly contrasts with the FDS claim that restricting sex is the best way to elicit investment from male partners.

Birnbaum and colleagues (2021) directly examined whether sexual desire serves as a mediator between perceiving a partner as high in mate value and engaging in relationship-promoting behaviors. Across five studies, including lab experiments, daily diaries, and longitudinal designs, they found that greater perceived mate value predicted heightened sexual desire for their partner, which in turn predicted responsiveness, sacrifice, and other investment behaviors. Importantly, the causal direction was tested: recalling events that highlighted a partner’s value increased sexual desire, which then increased willingness to invest for men and women. This demonstrates that desire is not merely a byproduct of investment but a motivational force that drives it. These results are particularly compelling as they were consistent despite the varying methods and designs, reflecting reliability. Moreover, that the mediating effect of sexual desire was determined in lab studies and the diary studies speaks to external validity.

However, some limitations remain. Most participants were young, heterosexual couples from Israel or U.S. universities, which narrows generalizability. The experimental manipulations (e.g., recalling a sexual memory, allocating spa treatments) may also not fully capture the manifold expressions of sexual desire and investment in long-term relationships. Still, the converging evidence across methods strengthens the claim that sexual desire for one’s partners reliably predicts behaviors that sustain relationships.

If women follow the FDS imperative to suppress or withhold sexual desire in order to secure investment, they may be sabotaging one of the very mechanisms that motivates men to invest. Birnbaum’s findings suggest that men’s willingness to enact costly relationship-promoting behaviors is increased, not diminished, by sexual desire. To that point, it is especially notable that for men, the correlation between mate value and sexual desire is weaker than for women. This reflects that in contrast to FDS claims, a man’s perception of his mate's value is not necessarily indexed by sexual desire. 

In another set of studies, Birnbaum et al. (2020) explored how sexual priming influences impression management in self-presentation and during initial encounters with potential partners. Specifically, they tested whether participants exposed to sexual stimuli were more likely to conform to a stranger’s opinions, alter stated preferences to match a potential partner’s, and lie about the number of sexual partners. It was found that although the priming affected whether participants altered their profiles to match a potential mate, there was no such main effect on whether they lied about sexual history during direct interactions. As such, regardless of whether sexual desire was elicited in the participant, they would manage their impression in direct contexts. In this study, the authors used a mock-dating site paradigm to mimic the process of matching and chatting with potential mates on dating apps. The use of laboratory priming tasks raises some ecological validity concerns as watching erotic clips or subliminal images is not the same as experiencing genuine attraction in a natural setting. 

In relation to FDS, this evidence further undermines the idea that men’s sexual desire is antagonistic to intimate relationships. Whereas FDS claims that provoking sexual desire in men prevents the formation of a true and lasting connection, the null result of this study points to this not being the case.

Birnbaum and colleagues (2019) had also tested whether sexual desire fuels nonsexual behaviors that initiate and support relationships. In four studies involving tasks such as dancing, miming, conversation, and helping, sexual desire for a partner or confederate predicted synchrony, responsiveness, and helping behaviors. Sexual priming increased these affiliative behaviors, which in turn predicted interest in further interaction for men and women. This work demonstrates that sexual activation not only prompts sexual approach but also elicits caring and supportive behaviors that contribute to the building of attachment bonds. Strengths of this work include its use of observable behavioral outcomes (e.g., coded synchrony, helping) rather than self-reports alone, which makes the findings more compelling. Yet, as with the other studies, the samples were limited to young, heterosexual students in controlled settings. Despite these caveats, the pattern of results is reliable and as such, the evidence strongly indicates that desire facilitates the enactment of behaviors that increase closeness and likelihood of continued interaction.

From the perspective of FDS ideology, these data are particularly problematic. The community frames ease of sexual supply from women as the cause of their devaluation as serious intimate partners by men [@fdssubredditFemaleDatingStrategy2020]. Yet Birnbaum’s studies described above show that men’s experience of desire often increases their provision of care, responsiveness, and attention. Desire acts less like a discount on women’s value and more like a catalyst for the behaviors that sustain relationships. By advising women to withhold sex, FDS may inadvertently deprive them of opportunities to elicit the very gestures of romance they seek from men. 

To evaluate the FDS theory of heterosexual relationships, it is necessary not only to examine how sexuality relates to men’s and women’s behaviors, but also to investigate the underlying beliefs that sustain the ideology. Prior work by Rudman and colleagues directly addressed these foundational beliefs, offering evidence that challenges Sexual Economics Theory (SET) as proposed by Baumeister and Vohs.
Both FDS and SET rest on the claim that women treat sex as a scarce commodity that must be withheld and judiciously meted to men to preserve its value, and that women themselves are the enforcers of sexual restraint. If women truly view sex in these terms, then FDS’s guidance to restrict sexual access could be understood as a natural, functional strategy. However, if these assumptions are not borne out, then the logic underlying FDS is undermined. Rudman and colleagues have conducted a series of studies designed to test whether women are invested in sexual economics and whether they are chiefly responsible for upholding the sexual double standard.

Rudman, Fetterolf, and Sanchez (2013) compared male control theory, which posits that men suppress female sexuality, with female control theory, which posits that women suppress their own sexuality to protect the market value of sex. Surveying over 500 college students, they found stronger support for male control theory. Men were more likely than women to endorse the sexual double standard, and they gave sexual advice that reinforced it, with hostile sexism mediating these gender differences. Women also discouraged other women from casual sex, but this was linked more to concerns about stigma and rape myths than to sexual economics. A strength of this work is its large sample and systematic testing of competing theoretical accounts, which increases reliability and construct validity. A limitation is that the data relied on self-reported beliefs and perceived motives, which may not accurately predict how people act in real-world interactions where social desirability and peer dynamics exert pressure.

Building on this work, Rudman and Fetterolf (2014) directly tested SET’s central claim that women endorse sexual exchange more strongly than men. Across several studies using implicit association tests, ad-choice paradigms, and measures of sexual advice, the results consistently pointed in the opposite direction. Men were more likely to associate sex with money, to select ads that depicted sex as an exchange, and to encourage men more than women to pursue casual sex. Women, by contrast, resisted viewing sex as a commodity. Hostile sexism again mediated these gender gaps, suggesting that endorsement of sexual economics reflects men’s resistance to female empowerment rather than a strategy endorsed by women themselves. The inclusion of implicit and behavioral measures is a major strength, reducing the likelihood of self-report bias and increasing validity. However, the narrow demographic of U.S. college students limits generalizability, as the findings may not extend to older adults or cultural contexts where gender norms differ.

The review above suggest that the Female Dating Strategy’s guidance for women to withhold sex until men demonstrate investment rests on questionable rhetoric and unfounded claims. Whereas Birnbaum and colleagues show that sexual desire often motivates investment, Rudman and colleagues highlight that women are not the enforcers of a sexual marketplace. Together, this evidence challenges the belief that sex must be strategically restricted by women to maintain their value.

Additional empirical work further undermines the prescriptive value of FDS. Hazel, Barker, and Pronin’s (2023) review of research on playing hard-to-get, (e.g., abstaining strategically) demonstrates that although the tactic has long been promoted as effective, its reliability is suspect. Studies show that targets who are moderately selective are sometimes rated more attractive than those who are uniformly “easy” or “hard” to get. However, high uncertainty or extreme unavailability tends to reduce attraction and satisfaction. Importantly, the review highlights that attachment style and gender norms shape who employs this tactic and who finds it appealing, suggesting that it reflects cultural scripts more than universal, innate human dynamics. FDS’s blanket advice to delay sex to raise value therefore oversimplifies a strategy whose success is determined by many different factors.

Miner, Starratt, and Shackelford (2009) provide further nuance by examining how men’s mate value predicts their mate retention behaviors. Surveying women in long-term relationships, they found that men of higher mate value engaged more often in benefit-provisioning behaviors (such as affection and gifts) and less often in cost-inflicting tactics (such as jealousy induction or insults). In contrast, lower mate value predicted greater reliance on coercive behaviors. These findings complicate the FDS assumption that withholding sex can compel men to invest in a mate. Rather, men’s willingness and capacity to provide investment appears linked to their own characteristics and resources. This suggests that strategies centered solely on controlling sexual access may be ineffective if a partner’s baseline mate value is low.

Taken together, the weight of evidence indicates that cultivating sexual desire and fostering mutual responsiveness are more effective ways for eliciting care and commitment than strict adherence to reductive notions of sex as women’s currency. A more constructive recommendation for women would be to attend to indicators of partner responsiveness, reliability, and willingness to engage in benefit-provisioning behaviors. Encouraging early emotional and sexual communication may better predict sustained investment than delaying intimacy in hopes of extracting it.

In sum, while the FDS handbook encourages women to leverage sex transactionally, psychological research reveals that sexual desire, partner value, and responsiveness play central roles in relationship formation and maintenance. Applying empirical insights rather than economic metaphors offers a healthier and more effective guide for navigating heterosexual relationships.
