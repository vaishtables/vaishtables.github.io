## [@birnbaumSexualDesireMediates2021]

Claim: mate value → sexual desire → relationship-promoting behaviour
Relevance: FDS recommends that ♀︎ value ⤒ when ♂︎ have to earn physical intimacy, i.e. sex should be wielded as a bargaining chip so ♂︎ will invest resources and ⏱︎ into relationship
Method: diary study
Critique: 
If the authors are right, ♀︎ can index their partner’s valuation via  sexual desire
But it is possible that ♂︎ sexual desire is not necessarily determined by mate value and it is the other way around: sexual desire determines mate value which motivates relationship-promoting behaviours
It seems to be the case that for men, sexual desire is related to investment (counters FDS) and sexual desire is related to mate value but mate value is not necessarily related to investment (counters authors; ♂︎ need sex to invest)
The pathway for men is more likely to be that sexual desire motivates relationship investment when mate value is high
Also note that sexual desire was related to stated willingness to sacrifice but NOT actual sacrifice – can tie this to [@birnbaumMakingRightFirst2020a] which found that sexual desire was related to lying 

## @birnbaumMakingRightFirst2020a

Claim: when horny, people lie to impress potential mates
Relevance: FDS says ♀︎ should refrain from leaning on sexiness because ♂︎ will say anything to have sex
Method: studies 3 & 4 aimed to see if people would lie in their DMs and their dating profiles about how many sexual partners they’ve had when they’re horny vs. not and if there were gender differences. studies 1 & 2 indicate people lie to conform when horny, though
Critique: no effect of sexual priming on self-presentation ∴ doesn’t matter how turned on the guy is (counters FDS) nor gender BUT it’s odd that they looked at body count considering the cultural scripts for ♂︎ and ♀︎ are different. Maybe Israeli mores are different when it comes to sex.
