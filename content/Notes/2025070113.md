I was just going to edge my pussy for a _little_ bit before bed.

It had been a hard week at work and I deserved it, right?

Anyway, my roommate was out and wouldn’t be back for a few hours, so the idea of having the whole apartment to myself, empty, quiet, and private, was kinda making me horny. I’d been replaying Skyward Sword on the shared couch, trying not to think about it, trying to focus on the game, but my thoughts kept returning to clit…the way it was throbbing already, crying out to be touched. Before I knew it I was borderline obsessed with the idea of edging myself somewhere I shouldn’t.

The couch seemed like the perfect spot.

We ate dinner on that couch. Watched movies. Took naps.

It would be very wrong to make myself cum there…

I moved to the middle and slipped my panties around to my knees, enjoying the way it felt to be exposed like that in our shared space, my pussy out and already throbbing just from the taboo of being so naked.

I wasn’t going to do anything crazy. Just a gentle pressing on my lips, teasing my body, pulling on my nipples through my pajamas a little. It would be fun, right?

It might have been, if I hadn’t gotten so carried away…

…five minutes later I was a mess; sprawled out, my breasts completely exposed, nipples hard and sensitive from where I’d caressed them. My legs were open, _wide_, bent at the knees, my naked toes pressing into the cushion for leverage.

My panties were still tangled loosely around one thigh as I fucked myself gently and slowly with my fingers.

The game controller had slipped somewhere to the floor. I didn’t even remember dropping it. All I could focus on was the wetness between my legs, the tight circles over my clit, the obscene sounds of my pussy.

And the couch beneath me–our couch–was warm and damp where my thighs had been grinding into it. The wetness was spreading. I could feel it.

But I couldn’t stop.

I’d clean it up later, long before my roommate got back.

For now, I was right on the edge. Tense. Desperate. My hips lifting off the cushion, mouth parted, a shaky little whimper escaping my throat every time I brushed just right. I was so close it hurt–

–and that was when I heard the key turn in the lock.

Panic. Pure, electric panic.

I jumped back to my side of the couch, yanking the blanket down over my legs and pulling my shorts back up just as the door opened. He stepped in. My roommate. Bag slung over one shoulder, hoodie slightly rumpled, keys jangling in his hand. Same soft-smile expression as always. My heart was still slamming in my chest.

“Hey,” he said, as if everything was normal, as if I wasn't being a horny needy desperate slut only a few minutes before.

I tried to swallow the guilt off my face. “Hey.”

“You gaming?”

“Yeah Yup. ”

He dropped his bag by the door, then–of course–walked straight over and flopped down on the couch. On the opposite end.

Barely two feet from me.

And even closer to the wet patch; a shimmering, glistening pool of my cum in the middle of the couch.

It still looked warm.

_Fuck._

I didn’t breathe.

He leaned back, totally relaxed, arm stretched out behind the cushions, head tilted. “Whatcha playing?”

I blinked. “Zelda.”

He nodded. “Cool.”

I could smell myself. God. The smell of sex. Still fresh in the air. Slick between my legs. My fingers curled into the blanket to keep from fidgeting. His fingers were inches from it. Obscene and obvious.

He didn’t move his hand. Fingers relaxed, pinkie practically hovering above the edge of the wet spot I’d left behind. If he noticed anything–any scent, any damp warmth, any vibe–he didn’t show it.

“I didn’t know you were back so soon,” I said, my voice a little too bright as I picked up the controller.

He shrugged. “Yeah. Caught the early train. Place looked dark when I got in.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Just trying to get a little atmosphere going for the game. Didn’t mean to scare you.”

He laughed. “Nah, it’s all good.”

I smiled, but the worst part was that my clit was still throbbing. Every part of me was hyper-aware; my thighs damp, my fingers sticky, my pussy still aching for more.

He stretched again, lazily, and his knuckles brushed the fabric just beside the wet patch.

I froze.

Did he feel it?

Did he know?

And then, even worse, he shifted closer. Just a few inches. Not much. But enough that I felt the couch give beneath us, dipping, making the wetness spread ever so slightly under the pressure. It was still soaking into the cushion.

His eyes dropped, just briefly, to the blanket over my lap, then flicked back up.

“Did you spill something?”

My stomach dropped. “What?”

He gestured vaguely toward the cushion between us. “It’s…shiny.”

My whole body lit up in embarrassment.. “Oh. yeah, uh. Water. From earlier. I spilled. It’s nothing.”

A pause.

"It doesn’t look like water."

I swallowed. “Yeah.”

I laughed awkwardly, my head completely devoid of all coherent thought, of any single convincing lie I would tell. My critical faculties had completely shut down, and at that moment I was nothing more than an aching pussy and embarrassment.

He pressed his finger gently to the wet patch and held it up, observing it.

I felt my pussy clench and I held my breath.

\[Part two if people are interested in hearing the rest]


\[f] The backrub…

I was lying on my stomach in a t-shirt that barely reached past my ass. It hadn’t planned it that way, it was just what I was wearing when he came over. If I’d known I was going to get a surprise visit from my best guy friend, I would have put some less revealing underwear on lol

Anyway, we were hanging out watching people play the new mario kart on youtube when I started complaining about the knot in my back that was making it hard to sleep. Danny was nice about it, saying that I should try some stretches and stuff, and that's when I jokingly asked if he wanted to give me a massage.

“Sure,” he said, with a shrug. “You got any oil or anything?”

“I have, actually!” I said, reaching into the little table by my couch. I’d bought the oil weeks ago (Johnson's baby oil) and had never used it, so I pulled it out triumphantly and handed it to him.

Suddenly I was face down on my living room couch, arms folded under my head, hair messy around my shoulders, my T-shirt up by my shoulders and my huge naked breasts crushed beneath me and pushed out to either side. It was only at that moment that I realised my enthusiasm for the oil had led me into a situation I hadn’t really considered fully.

“You good?” Danny asked, kneeling beside me.

“Uh huh,” I said, but inside I was feeling a cocktail of emotions. I mean, it was Danny. Sweet, harmless Danny, who’d seen me hungover, makeup-free, asleep on the bus. Danny who I’d cuddled with during horror movies and vented to about bad dates. There had never been anything like this between us. And yet here I was, half-naked, ass bare to the room, suddenly hyper-aware of my skin, the soft crush of my tits against the couch cushion.

It wasn’t that I didn’t trust him, it was that I wasn’t sure if I could trust myself; I hadn’t had sex in a while, so even just the thought of having a guy's hands on me was making me kind of wet.

Before I could change my mind, he started at my shoulders, thumbs pressing deep into the muscles around my spine.

“Is that okay?” he asked.

I clenched my pussy involuntarily.

“Yeah,” I mumbled. “Feels nice.”

On the screen, the volume lowered now, youtubers continued to explore tracks and speedrunning strategies. In my living room, Danny worked his fingers slowly down my back, spreading the lotion in firm circles. I could feel his thumbs drag close to the curve of my lower back, then pause. Not going lower. Not yet.

And every time he didn’t touch where I wanted, I got a little more turned on against my will.

I shifted slightly, and my breasts pressed out wider beneath me. I figured they were probably visible from behind, a fact which excited me and terrified me in equal measure. My back was ached already, pent up sexual frustration manifesting in my nipples, so fucking hard I just wanted to roll onto my back and have him suck them. But I couldn't. Instead, I shifted slightly, the friction of the couch under them was incredible.

“You’re tense,” he murmured, almost to himself. His hands paused. “You okay?”

I nodded again, a little too fast. “Yeah, just… yeah.”

The lotion smelled like eucalyptus. I tried to focus on it to take my mind off it, but all I could think was that if he moved even an inch lower, he’d be touching my ass.

“You want me to keep going?”

His voice was hoarse. Careful.

I didn’t answer – I felt too nervous and this felt too wrong, the naughtiness only increasing the hornyness. So I did the cowardly thing instead: I lifted my hips slightly.

He moved again. Down.

His hands were firmer now, kneading along fat ass, all the way down to the tops of my thighs, the bare flesh exposed. Then he went back up, his fingers brushed the crease where my thigh met my ass.

Fuck.

He didn’t say anything. Neither did I. Instead, I shifted again, lifting my hips a little higher. I wondered if he could see my pussy through my sheer underwear. I wondered if I was exposing myself. I wondered if he wanted to taste me.

His fingers moved again, closer this time.

One hand cupped the soft swell of one cheek, squeezing gently. The other traced the edge of me, so, so close to my slit I thought I might go mad.

I told myself he was just being thorough. But my breathing betrayed me, chest rising and falling, pushing my breasts forward against the cushion. His hands moved again, sliding upward, cupping the curves of my ass with firm, steady pressure. He kneaded them slowly, thumbs grazing inward toward the cleft between them.

I bit my lip.

I should have stopped him. This was just a massage. Just a friend helping a friend.

But my thighs were fucking wet now, and I could feel the cool air on my wet pussy. When his fingers brushed the edge of my clit, I gasped.

“Sorry,” he murmured. “Wasn’t trying to…”

I didn’t respond and his hand lingered, the backs of his fingers resting just above my opening. I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. He let his fingertips explore more deliberately now, sliding slowly along the edges of me without dipping in. Teasing. Tracing. Testing. My hips twitched forward again, pushing myself subtly into his hand.

Then his fingers spread me. I was soaked. I could feel it. Still, he didn’t touch me directly. His thumbs rested at the edges, and I knew he was looking at me now, spread and vulnerable and desperate and twitching.

My chest ached. My breasts pressed so hard into the cushion. I shifted slightly, trying to ease the pressure, but the movement only made my thighs spread wider, presenting myself more blatantly to him.

I felt his hand slide up along the curve of my ass again. This time he let his thumb brush across the tight ring of my asshole. Just a passing touch. Feather-light.

I moaned before I could stop myself.

It wasn’t loud, but it was enough.

Enough to let him know.

Enough to make it clear.

“Do you want me to keep going?” he asked.

I arched my back, pushed into him, and let out a long, slow exhale, and I knew that whatever he wanted to do to me, I was going to allow it…

He didn’t move right away.

His hand just stayed there, resting lightly, thumb grazing the rim of my ass, fingers warm and open against the curve of me. I felt a pulse deep inside, an ache so sharp I almost whimpered. My body was screaming for him to push inside me.

But he didn’t move. Justy held me there. Open.

I imagined him looking at me, spread, taking his time, finally enjoying what he’d longed to see for so many years; his best friend’s open dripping submissive pussy between his fingers.

I was so fucking wet, too.

“I don’t want to cross a line,” he murmured, holding me open. I would have laughed at the contradiction if I wasn’t so fucking horny.

Instead, I stayed silent. I knew that if I tried to talk, I might beg.

My body must’ve looked obscene in that moment; shamelessly offered up on the couch, my hips tilted back, skin gleaming with baby oil, my curves on full, desperate display. My t-shirt had ridden so high it barely covered the tops of my shoulder blades, and beneath it, the heavy weight of my tits spilled outward against the cushion like they couldn’t be contained. They were huge, soft and pale, glistening slightly from sweat and friction, flattened and pushed wide by my own weight, the sides of them visible even from behind. My nipples were diamond-hard, dragging slightly against the fabric beneath me with every shallow breath I took.

So I just tilted my hips again, pushing my tits down into the couch and pushing my ass back. My thighs parted further.

His hands slid back to my hips and he started to massage again.

I was so fucking disapointed I could have cried.

But it wasn’t over yet, and he moved his hands across my body, kneaded the soft flesh of my ass, fingers dragging in toward my slit without ever quite touching it. His thumbs drew lazy circles just shy of my most sensitive places.

“You’re shaking,” he said. “Are you okay?”

“Mmmhmmm,” I managed through closed lips. I didn’t want to tell him that I was shaking from being on the edge of orgasm already; shaking because he had been edging my clit for about 10 minutes now.

I felt my pussy clench again. I wondered if he could see how wet I was. I wondered if he knew.

Of course he knew.

One of his hands slid down again. He let the back of his fingers brush down the center of my pussy. Featherlight. A tease.

I gasped.

He paused. Then did it again.

“Jesus,” he whispered, mostly to himself. “You really like that, huh?”

I opened my mouth to answer but he silenced me with the first proper stroke; two fingers pressing gently along the soaked seam of my pussy, sliding slowly from my slit to the crease of my ass. I pushed back into him without thinking.

“Is this too far?” he asked.

I shook my head violently. “No. Oh my god no. It's…_fuck_…it's perfect.”

That was all it took.

I felt his hand again. Hot. Wide. Cupping my bare pussy with obscene gentleness. His palm pressed in softly, not quite moving, just…there. Holding my soft smooth lips. I tried to rock back into him again but he just continued to touch me so lightly I could have screamed. The sensation was unbearable. My lips parted under him, wet and swollen.

Finally…fucking FINALLY…he began to stroke; slow, teasing passes that didn’t go too deep. Just enough to make me rock forward. His fingers never quite slid inside me. Just circled the entrance, gently caressing my clit.

“You’re so wet,” he said quietly.

“Yes…” I made a small, broken sound. I couldn’t help it.

His thumb brushed up, dragging lightly across my clit. I bucked. He did it again. Slower. Teasing me with just the pad of his thumb, barely any pressure still. Like he wanted to see how long he could keep me on the edge without pushing me over it.

“Danny,” I gasped.

“Yeah?” His voice was low. Rough.

“I—” I started, then stopped, because I didn’t know what I was asking for. More? Harder? Inside me?

Instead, I pressed my face harder into the cushion, and one hand slipped between my thighs instinctively. But before I could touch myself, he caught my wrist.

“No,” he murmured. “Let me.”

Then I felt him shift behind me. Kneeling now, between my legs. I could feel the heat of him, close and looming. His hands slid along the insides of my thighs, pushing them wider. I was shaking.

I felt the first kiss like a shock, his lips pressed to the soft swell of my inner thigh, maddeningly close. Then another. And another.

Fuck.

It was torture, that teasing pressure, every shift of my body making them throb more, sensitive and aching and hungry for touch. I knew they looked ridiculous; huge, overripe, practically begging for someone to cup them, squeeze them, bite them. My back curved deeply, arching almost unconsciously, as if to make my waist look even narrower, as if to exaggerate the swell of my tits and the roundness of my ass.

My thighs trembled, parted wide, every movement causing a ripple through the curves of my body. I imagined what he was seeing from behind, my back glistening with oil, my ass up, my pussy dripping and parted between my spread thighs, and beneath it all, the heavy, jiggling swell of breasts that had always seemed a little too much for my frame. I’d hated them when I was younger. Now, flattened under me and sensitive as hell, I just wanted Danny to lick and suck and pull and slap.

“Do you want me to kiss it?” Danny said from somewhere behind me. “Or should I lick it instead?”

I moaned into the cushion. “Please, Danny. I need you to fucking lick it, now.”

I let out a broken, needy whimper, and I felt Danny’s weight shift beside me, leaning toward me as he ran his hand through my hair on the back of my head.

“That’s cool,” he said, his voice calm and enticing in a way I’d never heard before. “But first, you’re gonna need to beg…”


o it started as a quiet family holiday in a remote log cabin with no signal, no shops, and nothing to do. By day three, I was, to put it mildly, fucking horny. I’d been watching TV with my parents and rocking backward and forward on my heel, rubbing my clit against myself without them knowing (obviously), and It had got to the point where I knew I needed to do something about it.

So I had slipped into the sluttiest black lingerie and taken a few pictures and videos.

But it wasn’t enough. That’s when I started to tease the guy in the cabin opposite.

I thought he might have gone now, returned to whatever he was doing, but no; he was still there, standing by the window, drink in hand, eyes fixed on me.

I stood at the edge of the bed, the cabin air cool against my bare thighs, my grey joggers and hoodie now pooled on the floor behind me. My nipples ached against the mesh, the garter belt pulling tight around my waist, the thong pulled high, lace biting into my hips and pussy. I shifted slightly, and the fabric dragged against my clit. It felt fucking A M A Z I N G

And he was still watching.

I pretended not to notice him. Walked slowly to the mirror, hips rolling ever so slightly with each step. I bent forward a little, just enough to make the curve of my ass more obvious in the reflection. I straightened the garter strap, ran a hand up over my thigh, adjusted the lace where it clung to my pussy.

My parents were literally in the next room. I could hear the clink of glasses, the murmur of conversation, a burst of laughter from the TV. If they walked past my door…

I exhaled.

My fingers drifted across my stomach, up to my tits. They bulged from the fabric, obscenely big. I cupped them through the mesh, pushing them together, enjoying the way it felt, letting the fabric stretch just enough to expose the dark edge of one nipple.

Across the way, the man took a step closer to the window.

And then I saw her. His girlfriend or wife. Whoever she was, she must have been in the next room over, because she was brushing her hair in the reflection of their mirror, utterly oblivious. That's when he realised he was being just as naughty as I was, and that this was exactly the kind of wrong I needed lol

Let my hand slide down between my thighs. Just over the lace. Watching myself in the mirror.

Out of the corner of my eye, the soft movement as his hand pressed into his joggers. A slow, subtle shift, and then the unmistakable shape of his hard cock straining against the fabric.

I stood straighter, my breath catching in my throat. My pussy throbbed.

I pulled the thong gently to one side.

Not all the way.

Just enough for a peek.

My smooth pussy glistened in the warm lamplight.

The man’s hand moved again. Deeper now.

He was stroking himself.

Not fast. Not frantically. Slow and deliberate. Staring at me.

_How far should I push this_, I wondered.

I bit down on my bottom lip to keep from moaning and leaned forward toward the mirror. Bent at the waist, legs spread slightly. My thighs tensed. I glanced at the guy opposite again. His mouth was slightly open. His knuckles moved slowly, rhythmically. His girlfriend was still in the next room, now fluffing a pillow.

Fuck it. It was now or never.

I climbed up onto the bed and turned to face the window, my knees sinking into the soft mattress as I moved toward the headboard. My back arched. My thighs parted. I pushed my pussy out toward him, presenting myself, resting on my forearms with my ass high in the air, deliberately offering him the filthiest, most intimate view of me possible.

My pussy was soaked, lips spread by the position, glistening in the low cabin light. I heard the floorboards creak faintly downstairs, my parents still awake, still just one wrong footstep away, and the danger just made it hotter; I was too far gone now, the hornyness taking over.

I reached beneath myself with shaking fingers and touched my clit.

I moaned into the mattress, soft and low. My fingertips circled slowly, then faster, my breath growing more ragged with each pass. I let my legs fall a little wider, spreading even more, presenting myself fully to the window, knowing exactly how filthy I looked like this, a desperate little thing, naked from the waist down, my tits bouncing with each gyration, hunched forward and fingering myself.

I looked back over my shoulder.

He was still there.

And now? His joggers were pulled halfway down his thighs.

His hand pumped steadily along the full length of his cock, his eyes locked on the way I writhed for him, pussy exposed and trembling, dripping onto the bedsheets with every stroke of my fingers.

And behind him, like a fever dream, his girlfriend, moving through the background, completely unaware. She’d lit a candle. Set a glass of water by their bed. Jesus. She looked like she was _humming_. This was so wrong.

And, watching his pure and innocent girlfriend in the next room while I was bent over like a whore, legs spread, fingers inside myself, while her boyfriend jerked off at the sight of me, I started to cum all over my own fingers.

I buried my face in the sheets and bit down hard.

My climax hit like a wave, crashing through me, sharp and sudden and soaked. I moaned low and desperate into the mattress, body shaking, thighs clenching, clit pulsing. I felt it flood out of me, my cum dripping down my inner thighs.

Panting. Spent. Still face-down, my ass bare to the window, legs trembling.

Eventually, I turned to look back, but he was gone. Curtains drawn. Like it had never happened at all.

Except I was lying here, panties ruined, soaked through with my own mess, the scent of my pussy filling the cabin, my heart still pounding.

I knew I should clean up; change the sheets, wipe down, pretend nothing happened. But instead I just lay there in the dark, legs still parted, breathing heavy, wondering if he was lying in bed now with his girlfriend curled up beside him…my perfect little pussy still filling his thoughts.

For the first time since I started the holiday, I was looking forward to the next night…
