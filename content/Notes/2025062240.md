    - **bounded** by __space & time__

synergy
: components working together

***
- w/i a sys., the pattern of infl. is **circular** rather than __linear__

***
circularity of influence
: change in 1 component of the sys. has implications for all others
: cf. mutuality

***
disequilibrium
: a state in which there is a sig. change in a family member/rel. btwn. family members
