# Statement of Purpose
## Brainstorm
- my research interests: cognition, learning, decision-making, measurement
- big why:
    - think it’s cool to break down how and why we think; what individual differences or external factors are implicated in these mechanisms at a basic level?
        - especially with learning
            - look up that Minda Lab member’s blurb about implicit learning
            - how are rules learned? how do we learn to make judgements and decisions from experiences/memories/feedback
            - what is the meaning of risk?
        - implicit learning
            - learning associations from experience/associative learning
                - conception of risk
