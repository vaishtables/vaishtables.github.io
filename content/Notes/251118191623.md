# Statement of Purpose

My goal is to complete a Master’s degree and, ultimately, a PhD to become a principal investigator examining the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making, language, and learning. I am especially excited by the potential of computational modelling for capturing these processes with precision and accounting for individual differences. Throughout my experiences in research, working across multiple disciplines, I have come to appreciate how different methods can be integrated to understand how we think and behave. I believe that building the most complete models of human thought and behaviour requires an eclectic approach, one informed by an integration of qualitative and quantitative methods.

My introduction to research came through an invitation to the Jackman Scholars-in-Residence program, a summer research fellowship for upper-year humanities students. I was selected to work under the mentorship of Dr. Jessica Fields, a sociologist interested in the stories of LGBTQ+ life in secondary schools. I was drawn to the framing of autobiographical data as storytelling. As a peer researcher in the early stages of the project, I contributed personal insights to team discussions and assisted with transcription and autoethnographic field notes. Our qualitative data showed that authority figures’ focus on preventing risk often obscured the underlying motivations—desire, identity formation, and meaning-making—that shaped young people’s decisions. This project also gave me early practice communicating research to wider audiences through digital infographics and blog posts. I also presented on the ethical challenges that can emerge in peer research within a research team. Above all, Dr. Fields and the other investigators modeled a strong ethic of care when working with participants and undergraduate researchers, and I hope to exercise the same should I one day lead a team.

Dr. Fields kindly invited me to continue as a peer researcher, this time during an investigation of risk-taking among young women and non-binary people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In an expanded role, I conducted semi-structured interviews with participants and assisted with qualitative coding. Analyzing the transcripts revealed how individual choices were profoundly shaped by the social structures that constrained them. Working within an international research team further sharpened my awareness of cultural competence, a topic I presented on during our training sessions. During this period, public messaging was focused almost exclusively on safety, avoiding harm, and minimizing risk. Yet our participants emphasized that being denied the opportunity to take risks also meant being denied potential rewards and the developmental value of learning from those experiences. This project strengthened my interest in how individuals make sense of their choices and in how mixed-methods approaches can clarify the motivations behind them. I also assisted Dr. Laina Bay-Cheng, a co-investigator and psychologist, in a substudy where I contributed to inter-rater reliability calculations—my first exposure to integrating qualitative insights with quantitative methods.

At this point, I had become increasingly interested in using experimental methods to understand cognition, informed by my coursework in cognitive psychology and statistics. I wanted to examine the rules and mechanisms that guide how individuals make sense of the world at a more fundamental level, which led me to join the Experimental Semantics Lab headed by Dr. Lyn Tieu. The project investigated whether emoji contribute meaning in ways comparable to gestures. For instance, just as a steering-wheel gesture following “I will be visiting an old friend” leads a listener to infer that the speaker will be driving, we hypothesized that an emoji appearing after a message could trigger similar inferences. A central challenge, however, was that written text is linear, whereas gesture meaning depends on timing; a gesture that occurs after speech rather than during it can feel awkward or alter its interpretation. Our pilot study showed that reliably translating timing effects into written text was not intuitive.

Our small team experimented with different solutions, including manipulating emoji placement. I also independently coded animated stimuli in JavaScript to display messages and emoji in sequence, creating a naturalistic chat interface in which timing could be controlled. After implementing these changes, we found support for our predictions. While it was satisfying to see our hypothesis supported and to contribute to the methodological solution, I was especially compelled by the future directions this work opened—for example, examining how listeners process the meaning of “ungrammatical” or unexpected uses of emojis and gestures across modalities. Presenting our findings at conferences and invited talks, and receiving feedback from colleagues, helped us refine our interpretation of the results. This work culminated in my first publication as a co-author in the _Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology_ and further solidified my interest in formal and experimental approaches to language and cognition.

- At this point in my research career, I’ve started to think about cognition like everyday experience → computational process whereby meaning is created → formalizing it
    - I had excelled in statistics courses and taken up R and Python on my own time
- I should address the fall in my academic performance that year due to personal circumstances
    - But I did quite well in the fMRI course headed by Andy Lee
- Got really invested in the idea of developing robust models or theories that are also biologically plausible
- If we want to know how the brain understands the world, we must consider in parallel to the general rules we propose from the behavioural patterns we observe, how neural structures actually implement those mechanisms
- So for my supervised thesis, I worked with Andy because his lab had stuff looking at the MTL which is implicated in the processes I was interested.
    - One focus of the lab was approach-avoidance conflict, i.e., making decisions where outcomes can be positive or negative
        - A grad student was interested in using a computational approach to examine how people learn when to make a risky choice and when to play it safe as they experienced feedback; used reinforcement learning models
            - Had an issue with MLE; boundary effects so I independently coded Bayesian hierarchical reinforcement learning models using Stan
            - Compared a bunch of models to see which was the best
        - We could see that people generally adapted their choices to better than expected feedback and less so for worse than expected; this supports a theory of a general optimism bias
        - I was curious about the individual level performance; what distinguished the participants who were better at the task, or more strategic or whatever
            - association between grit and learning effectively from worse-than-expected punishments
                - exciting that perhaps the conceptual definition of resilience (adapting to negatives) was showing up here; needed to study further to make any claims with certainty
                - want to do more research mapping algorithms to behaviour and inferring neural mechanisms and then also trying to figure out individual differences based on personality show up or maybe population  differences

- I suppose I want somehow to use what I know about modelling to  study the cognition of meaning ()

Looking ahead, I hope to build an interdisciplinary program of research that brings these strands together: investigating how individuals learn from feedback, how meaning is constructed across contexts and modalities, and how these processes vary across people. I aim to use computational models alongside experimental and qualitative approaches to develop integrative accounts of how people think, decide, and learn. The opportunity to pursue graduate training in an environment that values rigorous theory-building, methodological breadth, and collaborative inquiry would provide an ideal setting in which to develop this work and to continue growing as a scientist.
