# PSY424 Final Paper – Outline

## Introduction
1. Background
    1. A lot of focus on the manosphere, but not its distaff counterpart.
    2. The Female Dating Strategy subreddit is a community prescribing rules for women, they have a handbook published
    3. Their insights are derived from community contributions as well as popular 21st century bestsellers in the dating/self-help genre incl. _Why Men Love Bitches_, which is included in the syllabus.
    4. They guide the readeron how to identify and secure a relationship with a HVM and avoiding LVM.
    5. Define HVM
    6. The topic at hand is one that has been empirically studied before: “Playing Hard to Get”
    7. Define PHTG (signalling high status & withholding sex)
    8. I will be looking at the latest literature concerning this strategy and whether it has any merit
    9. Misandry, I am inclined to believe that some of their practical recommendations make sense but their transactional view of romance will ultimately lead to poor relationship outcomes.
